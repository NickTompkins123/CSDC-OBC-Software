Quickstart Guide for SAM3X-EK Demo Application
------------------

(Original Source: http://www.freertos.org/Atmel_SAM3_SAM3X-EK_SAM3S-EK2_RTOS_Demo.html)

The following will help you set up the development environment necessary to Flash the FreeRTOS SAM3X-EK Demo onto any board with a ATSAM3X chip.  

1. Download the Atmel IDE from here: http://www.atmel.com/microsite/atmel_studio6/default.aspx. Atmel Studio 6 is built around Visual Studio 10 and works exactly the same way. It's well made, fully featured IDE.

2. Open RTOSDemo.atsln to open the project. The source files should be viewable within Atmel Studio

3. Do what you need to do via the solution explorer and navigating between files

4. Hit F7, or go Build->Build Solution in order to build the project. The project should successfully compile with no errors. If not, try clean and Build again,

5. (TBD) Burn the program onto the dev board using the SAM ICE
